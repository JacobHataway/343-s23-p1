  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Site must contain 5 separate pages:</h3>
      <p>My site contains the 5 pages that are found on the navigation bar: Home, Order Now, Locations, About, and
        Checkout.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Each page must declare favicon:</h3>
      <p>Each page has a cookie favicon set.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Site must include header:</h3>
      <p>Across all pages there is a header that remains at the top of the screen.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Site must include nav links:</h3>
      <p>Included in the header is a nav bar that links to all pages.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Site must handle screen sizes with media queries:</h3>
      <p>The site utilizes media queries in several places. In the home, about, and locations tab the images switch
        from being inline with the text to being over the text. In the 'order now' tab the grid changes dimensions
        depending on screen size. Other components on this page like buttons and images also change width depending on
        screen size.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Site validate on Nu Validator and WAVE:</h3>
      <p>The site validates on both websites. There is one warning about a redundant link on the home page, but I was
        unable to keep the functionality of the link while fixing the error. I think it may have something to do with
        the header being sticky. This means that the links are 'adjacent' even though they don't appear that way
        intuitively.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Site must contain different font faces:</h3>
      <p>The site has two fonts. Headings use Verdana fonts, while paragraphs use Lucida Sans.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Site must contain a form:</h3>
      <p>The site contains a large form on the checkout page. All inputs are aligned and validate their content.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Site must link to external sites:</h3>
      <p>The site links to other sites in the footer. I used this space to link sources for the images and resources I
        used.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
